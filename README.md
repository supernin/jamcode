# jamcode
trying to figure out if any programmers are trying to shorten code: personally i'm not a programmer but have an idea on a way to shorten code, I basically want to see if anyone and/or group can help...I'm trying to figure out if there's a way to map the source in patches kinda like a street map for source language via (and this is me being a little confident) street names or symbols that represent common code.

ja"m"code=jamcode  /= "m"
